## Code Review

- Index.php - Nice work with the graphical interface! It looks really cool!!
 
- Index.php:49 - You could add a "autocomplete="off" to avoid getting suggestion.
 
- App/users/account.php:39-40 - Don't forget to both sanitize and validate the email. As of now I can update to a non valid email. And I get stuck at http://localhost:8000/app/users/account.php if I leave the "new email"-input blank or type in the wrong current email.
 
- App/users/account.php:24 - When trying to change password, if I type in the wrong current password I get stuck at http://localhost:8000/app/users/account.php. You should add an else on your if-statement.
 
- App/users/delete.php: - You should also unlink the post images from /uploads/posts.
 
- App/users/delete.php:15 - Right now the unlink of the avatar image is not working properly. The folder is named upload/avatar but in the code you've written upload/avatars. A minor typo, which is easily fixed!
 
- Functions.php: Don't forget to write the type in your parameters! :)
 
- Functions.php:116 &. 120 - When you use this function in ex. account.php:38 you're sending the user-id as a parameter but you're not using it in the function. You could either skip the parameter $userId and just write `$_SESSION['user']['id']` directly, like you aldready have. Or change line 120 (in functions.php) to $userId to prevent from repeating yourself.
 
- Main.css:14-20 - This is merely a suggestion!! Instead of using an img-tag for the backgrounds, you could use the background-image property in CSS which automatically stays in the background and is easier to handle! :)

- It's currently possible to update avatar without actually adding a file.
